SF2DISASM
=========

A disassembly of the game "Shining Force II" for documentation and fan-project purposes, which can be assembled back into a bit-perfect replica of the original rom file.
Main branch can be found here :

The purpose of this branch is to have patch that increase the maximum range of the spells, items and weapons from 3 to 7.
